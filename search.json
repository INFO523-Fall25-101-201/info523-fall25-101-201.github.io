Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\n\n\nInclusive Community\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with UArizona’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official UArizona records, please let me know! You’ll be able to note this in the Getting to know you survey.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website: https://info523-fall25-101-201.github.io.\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Slack, make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to Get Help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the course Slack. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on Slack before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted on Slack, I encourage you to respond!\n\nCheck out the Support page for more resources.\nI want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you’re always welcome to talk to me. If I can’t help, I likely know someone who can.\nI want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.",

Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. Attendance will not be taken during class but you are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.

Knowing how to get help is part of that skill.\n\nBefore you ask for help:\n\nCheck for typos. One of the most common causes of errors are typos, which usually throw an error such as Error in _____ : could not find function “_____” due to a function being misspelled\nCheck loaded packages. You also get errors like Error in data %&gt;% summary() : could not find function “%&gt;%” when you failed to load a package.\nRead the error message. Don't ignore what R is telling you. Be aware that red text that appears in your console is not alwayws indication of errors. Sometimes it's just a warning.\nGoogle is your friend. Copy and paste the exact error message on a Google search. (this step also includes read the documentation on the package you're trying to use).\nIf you are still stuck, you an always try rubber duck debugging. Describe the problem aloud, explaining it line-by-line, to a rubber duck or another person (who might not have any experience with programming of data science). This is also a good preparation step to asking other people for help (next section).\n\n\n\nAsk other people for help\nLike mentioned before, you should ask your peers for help before you ask your instructor. Relying on a single person to solve all of your problems is dangerous, because that person won't be available throughout your career as a data scientist.\n\nCheck our Slack to see if someone else has asked a question similar to yours, and whether there's a solution posted for it.\nBe precise and informative. The more context you can provide about what you're trying to do and what errors you're getting, the better. Also describe the steps you took to try to solve the problem yourself.\n\n\n\nList of resources\n\nGetting Help with R\nRoger Peng's How To Get Help video\nRubber Duck Debugging",

Jake Thompson is a curated data set of Taylor Swift songs, including lyrics and audio characteristics. The data comes from Genius and the Spotify API.\nThere are three main datasets.\n\nThe first is taylor_album_songs, which includes lyrics and audio features from the Spotify API for all songs on Taylor’s official studio albums. Notably this excludes singles released separately from an album (e.g., Only the Young, Christmas Tree Farm, etc.), and non-Taylor-owned albums that have a Taylor-owned alternative (e.g., Fearless is excluded in favor of Fearless (Taylor’s Version)). We stan artists owning their own songs.\n\n\nYou can access Taylor’s entire discography with taylor_all_songs. This includes all of the songs in taylor_album_songs plus EPs, individual singles, and the original versions of albums that have been re-released as Taylor’s Version.\n\n\nFinally, there is a small data set, taylor_albums, summarizing Taylor’s album release history.\n\nInformation on the audio features in the dataset from Spotify are included in their API documentation.\nFor your visualizations, the {taylor} package comes with it’s own class of color palettes, inspired by the work of Josiah Parry in the {cpcinema} package.\nYou might also be interested in the tayoRswift package by Alex Stephenson, a ggplot2 color palette based on Taylor Swift album covers. “For when your colors absolutely should not be excluded from the narrative.”\n\nMetadata for taylor_album_songs``.csv:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nclass\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nalbum_name\ncharacter\nAlbum name\n\n\nep\nlogical\nIs it an EP\n\n\nalbum_release\ndouble\nAlbum release date\n\n\ntrack_number\ninteger\nTrack number\n\n\ntrack_name\ncharacter\nTrack name\n\n\nartist\ncharacter\nArtists\n\n\nfeaturing\ncharacter\nArtists featured\n\n\nbonus_track\nlogical\nIs it a bonus track\n\n\npromotional_release\ndouble\nDate of promotional release\n\n\nsingle_release\ndouble\nDate of single release\n\n\ntrack_release\ndouble\nDate of track release\n\n\ndanceability\ndouble\nSpotify danceability score. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n\n\nenergy\ndouble\nSpotify energy score. Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.\n\n\nkey\ninteger\nThe key the track is in.\n\n\nloudness\ndouble\nSpotify loudness score. The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track.\n\n\nmode\ninteger\nMode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n\n\nspeechiness\ndouble\nSpotify speechiness score. Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.\n\n\nacousticness\ndouble\nSpotify acousticness score. A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.\n\n\ninstrumentalness\ndouble\nSpotify instrumentalness score. Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.\n\n\nliveness\ndouble\nSpotify liveness score. Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\n\n\nvalence\ndouble\nSpotify valence score. A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n\n\ntempo\ndouble\nThe overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n\n\ntime_signature\ninteger\nAn estimated time signature. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). The time signature ranges from 3 to 7 indicating time signatures of “3/4”, to “7/4”.\n\n\nduration_ms\ninteger\nThe duration of the track in milliseconds.\n\n\nexplicit\nlogical\nDoes the track have explicit lyrics.\n\n\nkey_name\ncharacter\nThe key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.\n\n\nmode_name\ncharacter\nModality of the track.\n\n\nkey_mode\ncharacter\nThe key of the track.\n\n\nlyrics\nlist\nTrack lyrics. These values are all NA.

You will identify patterns, detect outliers, and generate insights based on your findings.\n\nTask 1: Data Overview\n\nLoad the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and display the first few rows.\nProvide a basic description of the dataset, including its shape, columns, and data types.\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nUse functions like .head(), .shape, .columns, and .dtypes to get an overview of your DataFrame.\nRemember that .info() can be used to get a concise summary of the DataFrame including the non-null count and type of each column.\n\n\n\n\nTask 2: Univariate Analysis\n\nFor numerical features, calculate descriptive statistics and create histograms.\nFor categorical features, count unique values and create bar plots.\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nUse .describe() for a quick statistical summary of the numerical features.\nUtilize matplotlib or seaborn libraries to create histograms (hist() or sns.histplot()).\nFor categorical data, value_counts() can help in understanding the distribution of classes, and you can plot the results using bar() or sns.countplot().\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Bivariate Analysis\n\nChoose three pairs of numerical variables and create scatter plots to explore their relationships.\nCreate boxplots for one numerical variable grouped by a categorical variable.\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nWhen creating scatter plots with plt.scatter() or sns.scatterplot(), it might be helpful to color points by a third categorical variable using the hue parameter in Seaborn.\nUse sns.boxplot() to create boxplots. Consider using the hue parameter if you have sub-categories within your categorical variable.\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Missing Data and Outliers\n\nIdentify any missing values in the dataset.\nDetect outliers in the numerical features using an appropriate method (e.g., Z-score, IQR).\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nThe .isnull() method chained with .sum() can help identify missing values.\nConsider using the scipy.stats module for Z-score computation or the IQR which is the range between the first and third quartile of your data distribution for outlier detection.",

    "text": "Deliverables\n\nProposal\nYour proposal should include:\n\nA one sentence description of your high-level goal (such as the ones listed under Ideas above.\nA one to two paragraph description of your goals, including your motivation. Depending on the focus of your project, the following might go in here.\n\nIf using particular dataset(s), a brief description of each dataset including the reason why you chose the particular dataset, its dataset, its dimensions and any other relevant metadata. (Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)\nIf answering a particular research question, the question itself and the reason why you chose this question.\n\nA weekly “plan of attack” outlining your steps to complete your project and including the team member(s) assigned to that task.\nThe final organization of your project repository. This means describing the project organization in your proposal as well as implementing that organization in your repo. Create any folders needed and place a README.md in each folder explaining what goes in there.\n\n\n\nPeer review\nThe peer reviews will be completed during the lab sessions as indicated above. On those days teams will have access to the project repos of the teams whose work they’re reviewing. The first peer review will be of proposals and the second peer review will be of code and organization.\n\nReviewer tasks\nTeams will develop the review together, with discussion among all team members, but only one team member will submit it as an issue on the project repo. To do so, go to the Issues tab, click on the green New issue button on the top right, and then click on the green Get started button for the issue template titled Proposal peer review or Code peer review.\nThis will start a new issue with a peer review form that you can fill out. Make sure to update the introductory paragraph with your team name and the names of the team members participating in the review. Then, answer each of the questions in the spaces provided underneath them. You’re expected to be thorough in your review, but this doesn’t necessarily require lengthy responses.\nRemember, your goal is to help the team whose project you’re reviewing. The team will not lose points because of issues you point out, as long as they address them before I review their work. You should be critical, but respectful in your review. Also remember that you will be evaluated on the quality of your review. So that’s an additional incentive to do a good job.\n\n\nReviewee tasks\nOnce you receive feedback from your peers, you should address them. You should do this by directly updating your proposal or making any other updates to your repo as needed. You can do these updates all in one commit or you can spread it across multiple commits. Regardless, in the last commit that addresses the peer review comments, you should use a keyword in your commit message that will close the peer review issues. These words are close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, and resolved and they need to be followed by the issue number (which you can find next to the issue title). So, your commit message can say something like “Finished updates based on peer review, fixes #1”.\n\n\nPeer review assignments\nThe peer review assignments for proposal peer reviews are TBD:\nThe peer review assignments for code peer reviews are TBD\n\n\n\nWrite-up\nYour have a lot of freedom in how you structure your write-up. This also comes with responsibility. You should make sure you have a clear introduction and a clear conclusion. You should also have other interim section headings that help the reader. Your write-up should be somewhere between 1000 and 2000 words. There is no expectation that you get close to the upper limit, anywhere in that range is fine as long as you have clearly explained yourself. The limits are provided to help you, not to set stressful expectations.\n\n\nPresentation\nYour presentation should generally follow the same structure as your write-up. Each team will have 5 minutes for their presentation, and each team member must speak (roughly equally) during this time.\nYou should create your presentation in a reproducible way, e.g., using Quarto. However you don’t have to use a package that is designed specifically for slides. If you prefer to build a dashboard or a Shiny app or a website, that’s fine too. The only rule is that it’s built reproducibly using R or Python.\nYour evaluation will be based on your content, professionalism (including sticking to time), and your performance during the Q&A (question and answer). We don’t care how many slides you use to do this.\n\n\nWebsite\nEach of your projects will have a website. You can use the same workflow as for your first project or create something different. For example, if your project is building a dashboard, you might consider making your write-up a tab on that dashboard. Or if it’s building a package, you might consider making your website using the pkgdown package.

If you do calculations by hand instead of using Python and then report the results from the calculations, you will not receive credit for those calculations. Any answers/results given without the corresponding Python code that generated the result will not be considered. For example, if you’re reporting the number of observations in your dataset, don’t just write the number manually, use inline Python code to calculate the number. All code reported in your final project document should work properly. Please do not include any extraneous code or code which produces error messages. Code which produces certain warnings and messages is acceptable, as long as you understand what the warnings mean. In such cases you can add warning: false and message: false in the relevant Python chunks. Warnings that signal lifecycle changes (e.g., a function is deprecated and there’s a newer/better function out there) should generally be addressed by updating your code, not just by hiding the warning.",

It differs from PCR by considering the response variable \\(Y\\) when determining the new feature space.\n\n\nPLS Transformation\n\\(T=XW^{*}\\)\nWhere \\(X\\) is the original dataset, \\(W^{*}\\) represents the weight matrix for PLS, and \\(T\\) represents the scores (latent variables).\nRegression on PCs\n\\(\\hat{Y} = TB + \\epsilon\\)\nWhere \\(T\\) are the PLS latent variables (predictors), \\(B\\) is the coefficient matrix, \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term\n\n\n\n\nDimensionality Reduction and Prediction: Reduces predictor dimensions while considering response variable \\(Y\\), optimizing for predictive power.\nHandles Multicollinearity: By generating latent variables, PLS mitigates multicollinearity, similar to PCR but with a focus on prediction.\nIncorporates Response in Feature Extraction: Unlike PCR, PLS extracts features based on their covariance with \\(Y\\), enhancing relevant feature capture.\nComponent Selection is Crucial: The number of latent variables (components) is key to model performance, typically determined via cross-validation.\nStandardization May Be Necessary: Just like PCR, variable scaling can be important depending on the data characteristics.\nSuitable for High-Dimensional Data: Effective in scenarios where predictors far exceed observations.\nDirect Interpretation Challenging: Coefficients apply to latent variables, complicating direct interpretation relative to original predictors."

People like to know who they’re dealing with and makes your username easier for people to guess or remember\nReuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack\nPick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss\nShorter is better than longer, but be as unique as possible\nMake it timeless. Avoid highlighting your current university, employer, or place of residence"

Common kernels include linear, polynomial, RBF, and sigmoid.\nDual Formulation: Simplifies the problem by focusing on Lagrange multipliers, allowing the use of kernel functions and making the problem solvable even when the feature space is high-dimensional or infinite.\nSupport Vectors: Data points corresponding to non-zero \\(\\alpha_i\\)​ values; these are the critical elements that define the hyperplane and margin.\nDecision Function: For a new data point \\(x\\), the decision function becomes \\(\\text{sign}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_i y_i K(x_i, x) + b\\right)\\), determining the class membership based on the sign of the output."

    "text": "Supervised machine learning\n\nSupervised learning is a paradigm in machine learning where input objects (for example, a vector of predictor variables) and a desired output value (also known as human-labeled supervisory signal) train a model. The training data is processed, building a function that maps new data on expected output values.\n\n\nBroadly categorized into two categories\n\n\nClassification\n\nThis type of supervised learning is used when the output variable is a category, such as “spam” or “not spam”, “malignant” or “benign”, etc. The goal is to predict discrete labels.\n\n\n\nRegression\n\nIn regression, the output variable is a real value, such as “salary”, “temperature”, or “height”. Regression is used for predicting continuous outcomes."

    "text": "Deliverables\n\nProposal\nYour proposal should include:\n\nA brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. (Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)\nThe reason why you chose this dataset.\nThe two questions you want to answer.\nA plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\n\n\nPeer review\n\nReviewer tasks\nEach team will review the proposals of two other teams. The peer review will be completed during class on Wednesday, January 31. On that day teams will have access to the project repos of the two teams whose work they’re reviewing. Reviews should start by cloning the team’s repo, re-rendering it locally to make sure you can reproduce their work, and then adding an issue to their repo with your peer review feedback.\nThe reviewer / reviewee assignments are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreviewer\nreviewee_1\nreviewee_2\n\n\n\n\nSeason's Screenings\nTech Titans\nWeather Gurus\n\n\nTech Titans\nWeather Gurus\nStats N Facts\n\n\nWeather Gurus\nStats N Facts\nTAAAG team\n\n\nStats N Facts\nTAAAG team\nAlgo Aces\n\n\nTAAAG team\nAlgo Aces\nSeason's Screenings\n\n\nAlgo Aces\nSeason's Screenings\nTech Titans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeams will develop the review together, with discussion among all team members, but only one team member will submit it as an issue on the project repo. To do so, go to the Issues tab, click on the green New issue button on the top right, and then click on the green Get started button for the issue template titled Peer review.\nThis will start a new issue with a peer review form that you can fill out. Make sure to update the introductory paragraph with your team name and the names of the team members participating in the review. Then, answer each of the questions in the spaces provided underneath them. You’re expected to be thorough in your review, but this doesn’t necessarily require lengthy responses.\nRemember, your goal is to help the team whose project proposal you’re reviewing. The team will not lose points because of issues you point out, as long as they address them before I review their proposals. You should be critical, but respectful in your review. Also remember that you will be evaluated on the quality of your review. So that’s an additional incentive to do a good job.\n\n\nReviewee tasks\nOnce you receive feedback from your peers, you should address them. You should do this by directly updating your proposal or making any other updates to your repo as needed. You can do these updates all in one commit or you can spread it across multiple commits. Regardless, in the last commit that addresses the peer review comments, you should use a keyword in your commit message that will close the peer review issues. These words are close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, and resolved and they need to be followed by the issue number (which you can find next to the issue title). So, your commit message can say something like “Finished updates based on peer review, fixes #1”.\n\n\n\nWrite-up\nYour write-up should consist of three parts:\n\nIntroduction (1-2 paragraphs): Brief introduction to the dataset. You may repeat some of the information about the dataset provided in the introduction to the dataset on the TidyTuesday repository, paraphrasing on your own terms. Imagine that your project is a standalone document and the grader has no prior knowledge of the dataset.\nQuestion 1: The title should relate to the question you’re answering.\n\nIntroduction (1-2 paragraphs): Introduction to the question and what parts of the dataset are necessary to answer the question. Also discuss why you’re interested in this question.\nApproach (1-2 paragraphs): Describe what types of methods you are going to make to address your question. For each method, provide a clear explanation as to why this method (e.g. imputation, transformation, correlation analysis, etc.) is best for providing the information you are asking about. The two methods should be of different types, and at least one of the two plots needs to use either color mapping or facets.\nAnalysis (2-3 code blocks, 2 figures / tables, text/code comments as needed): In this section, provide the code that generates your preprocessed data. Use plots with scale functions to provide nice axis labels and guides, or tables with clear purpose. You are welcome to use theme functions to customize the appearance of your plot or table, but you are not required to do so.\nDiscussion (1-3 paragraphs): In the Discussion section, interpret the results of your preprocessing. Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the correlations or summary statistics. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\n\nQuestion 2: Same structure outlined for Question 1, but for your new question. And the title should relate to the question you’re answering.\n\nWe encourage you to be concise. A paragraph should typically not be longer than 5 sentences.\nYou are not required to perform any statistical tests in this project, but you may do so if you find it helpful to answer your question.\n\n\nPresentation\nYour presentation should generally follow the same structure as your write-up. Each team will have 5 minutes for their presentation, and each team member must speak (roughly equally) during this time. Your presentation will be created using Quarto, which allows you to write slides using the same Quarto structure you’re used to. There is a sample Quarto slide template in your repo you can edit to your heart’s desire to create your presentation. Roughly I recommend 1 slide for introduction, 2 slides for Question 1, ans 2 slides for Question 2. You can imagine spending roughly one minute on each slide. You should feel free to have more (or fewer) slides. Your evaluation will be based on your content, professionalism (including sticking to time), and your performance during the Q&A (question and answer). We don’t care how many slides you use to do this.\n\n\nWebsite\nEach of your projects will have a website that looks like &lt;https://github.com/info523-fall25-101-201/project-01&gt;. You are not expected to change the styling of the website, but if you want to, you’ll need to edit the _quarto.yml file in your repo. Feel free to Google your way around it or ask on the discussion forum / office hours!"

This means putting all of the content in the Quarto files provided, rendering them to obtain the output, and committing and pushing all files to your repository by the indicated deadlines. Your Quarto files (.qmd) and the resulting html files (.html) will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (as in, don’t change the Quarto file without also updating the rendered document!).\nAll results presented must have corresponding code. If you do calculations by hand instead of using Python and then report the results from the calculations, you will not receive credit for those calculations. Any answers/results given without the corresponding Python code that generated the result will not be considered. For example, if you’re reporting the number of observations in your dataset, don’t just write the number manually, use inline Python code to calculate the number. All code reported in your final project document should work properly. Please do not include any extraneous code or code which produces error messages. Code which produces certain warnings and messages is acceptable, as long as you understand what the warnings mean. In such cases you can add warning: false and message: false in the relevant Python chunks. Warnings that signal lifecycle changes (e.g., a function is deprecated and there’s a newer/better function out there) should generally be addressed by updating your code, not just by hiding the warning."

For TidyTuesday we’ve used data through February 2021, but the full dataset, with data through the present, is available in the OSF project.\n\nIn this project, they synthesize an analysis-ready data set that tracks cage-free hens and the supply of cage-free eggs relative to the overall numbers of hens and table eggs in the United States. The data set is based on reports produced by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which are published weekly or monthly. They supplement these data with definitions and a taxonomy of egg products drawn from USDA and industry publications. The data include flock size (both absolute and relative) and egg production of cage-free hens as well as all table-egg-laying hens in the US, collected to understand the impact of the industry’s cage-free transition on hens. Data coverage ranges from December 2007 to February 2021.\n\nWe’ll use two datasets: egg-production.csv and cage-free-percentages.csv, which include monthly observations of egg production types, housing conditions, and the percentages of cage-free eggs.

We can look into how quickly it might get resolved and decide on what to do about the deadline accordingly. Note: We don’t anticipate this to happen regularly, the systems are Operational a huge majority of the time!\nIf the status shows Operational, this means the system is expected to be working. Check your internet connection, if need be, restart your computer to ensure a fresh new connection. If your issue persists, post on the course forum with details on what you’ve tried and the errors you see (including verbatim errors and/or screenshots).",
